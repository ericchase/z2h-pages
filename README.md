This project is meant to be a website hub for members of the Zero to Hero server. The idea is to get members to build static websites for themselves and host them in the same repo. There isn't much more to it than that. I'm hoping to motivate the community to work on their own web pages. I generally want the contents of each page to focus on and highlight the individual's personality, interests, hobbies, projects, and endeavors.

If there's anyone from the server who is interested in joining, please let me know.
