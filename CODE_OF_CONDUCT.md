Below are some of the rules for page content that owners must follow:

- **No Personal Content**: Strictly no personal IRL updates, news, or interpersonal drama. This is a hard rule to prevent doxing and the like.

- **No External News or Politics**: Do not include local/global news, political commentary, or discussions regarding countries, cultures, or religions, etc.

- **No Historical/Cultural Commentary**: Content involving the history of nations, cultures, or religious groups, etc., is prohibited.

- **No Infringing Material**: Do not upload anything that could trigger a DMCA takedown. You are responsible for ensuring you have the rights to everything in your folder. Anything that seems risky may be removed.

- **No Malicious Content**: Malicious code, harmful styles (CSS), or suspicious outbound links are forbidden and may be removed.

This list establishes a clear standard; use it to govern your content accordingly. If something you want to put on your page feels like it belongs on this list, then it's probably not allowed.
